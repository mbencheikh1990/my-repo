      <h3>Greetings!</h3>
      <p>Hello to anyone who is seeing this! My name is Mourad Bencheikh, and this is my first published website!
        I'm a student at the Flatiron School and I'm studying to become a programmer!</p>

    <section class="About-Me">
      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I guess I should talk about myself!
         Despite going to a technology-oriented high school, my parents encouraged me to do my major in "Criminal Justice," hoping I would one day become an attorney or something.
         That never panned out, and due to my ADHD I never really got the most out of secondary or post-secondary education.
         Despite enjoying the physical and life sciences and being pretty tech-savy, getting into programming didn't really cross my mind during my earlier years.
         I spent my twenties holding down a bunch of dead-end jobs to support myself, not really knowing what I was going to do with my life.
         Then I started to learn about coding bootcamps and how they can provide opportunities to those willing to work hard and learn, even if they don't have a degree.
         I've since been getting into programming and I am really growing to love it!
         I hope I can do something special with these skills that I am building and I hope the Flatiron School can help me take that next step towards a career as a programmer!</p>
